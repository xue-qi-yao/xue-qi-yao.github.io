Hi! I'm Qiyao Xue, currently a first year PhD student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Pittsburgh advised by [Prof Wei Gao](https://sites.pitt.edu/~weigao/). Before that, I obtained by bachelor degree with first class honor at Hong Kong Polytechnic University major in Electrical Engineering and minor in Applied Mathematics.

My research interest lies in multimodal generative AI, bridging language, vision, and audio that move toward world models capable of perceiving, reasoning, and generating across modalities.

In the past, I worked on deep learning, computer vision and natural language processing. I'm fortunate to had the opportunities to collaborate with [Prof Xiang Lorraine Li](https://lorraine333.github.io/) on natural language processing, [Prof Qi Dou](http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~qdou/) on medical image analysis.
